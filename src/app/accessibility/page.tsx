              <p>
                We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                (WCAG) 2.1 at Level AA. These guidelines explain how to make web
                content more accessible to people with a wide array of
                disabilities. Conforming to these guidelines also helps make
                content more usable for all users.

                Property Accessibility
              </h2>
              <p>
                Highland Farms is a working farm property set on five acres of
                forest and pasture land in Brightwood, Oregon. Due to the
                natural terrain, some areas of the property include uneven
                ground, gravel paths, and natural surfaces. We are happy to
                discuss specific accessibility needs and accommodations for your
                visit.
